# MERL Utility

Adapted from [the code release](https://brdf.compute.dtu.dk/) of:
> **On Optimal, Minimal BRDF Sampling for Reflectance Acquisition**
> Jannik Boll Nielsen, Henrik Wann Jensen, Ravi Ramamoorthi
> **TOG 2015**

The changes are minor:
1. `print` statements are updated according to the Python 3 syntax.
1. A typo in the comment section of `readMERLBRDF.py` is fixed.
